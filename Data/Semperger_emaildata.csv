(west light load currently does this in start view, but not active view)navigating around the scheduling sheet itself i was able to accurately execute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. multiple sorting will continue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the psw to acheive the same result.routing deals: will had deleted all routes for june th, starting me with a clean slate.  i made every path be for day. i was unable to confirm total unrouted mwh, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functioning in testp. the routing appeared to take  minutes with the status bar showing steady progress during that time. this time is - minutes longer than current speed using the excel macro system we have now. the error list gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful tool.  ok was visible on all rows that the psw believed that it had routed. i had difficulty checking the routing results, as i kept getting bde errors in scheduling after routing had occurred (local enpower). scheduling kept starting up in .  i was unable to login to testp through terminal server , but was able to in terminal server . the results there were very encouraging! most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they were routed properly. the deals that were not routed appear to be due to a user error of deal number duplication in the sheet. this is consistent with what i would expect. i will further evaluate routing ability with our more complicated paths later. this routing was very easy, a large point with on peak non shaped deals only. things i did not expect that i liked: when i highlight a group of cells in build route, it stays highlighted when i move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells.  this is very handy for double checking build route against the scheduler's sheet.what does not appear to be working at this time:the physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up properly in routing.path confirmation:  the running time appeared to be over one hour for one sheet, only  rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmation. this current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. also, many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and i cannot find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path confirmation. when the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze.  the status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined further.my conclusions:the build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production, the copy-paste function works well for the west desk per our connectivity issues.path confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowing up the app. no data was visible for june th even after the psw ran through its import function.please let me know when the issues i have named have been addressed and are ready for further testing.thankscara-"

 it will cut down on the daily routing.add (if possible)  error checking for missing supply or market deal numbers, why would this not be possible?  so much is driven by the deal number that to omit it would be a problem.   and missing physical or non-physical designation.  if nothing is specified in the phys? column, non-physical will be assume.questoin:  so far we have done nothing for the daily summary.  is this something that can wait, or do we need to get it done for this release? daily summary is a current function; creating data that i use to report our volumes to our traders, belden, and lavorato. this must be done for production, as they ask me for this often. yesterday, i found another problem, if i re-type a hour range in the sched hour cell in psw, it converts it to date format, and i get an ""invalid variant type conversion"" error.  nothing i did short of deleting the cells, making the changes in ms excel and re-pasting them worked.path confirmation report:need to enable text wrapping for path field.  the path field is the most important field of which to see all data. right now some paths are wrapped, and some aren't.   can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by tag.  provide a list of tags and show data for selected tag.sorting by global id - this needs to be able to be done in the upper sort area.  this is unclear.  what is meant by the upper sort area? the area where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria, up above the regular line view. not able to see the entire path in the ""expanded view"".  also, delivery points are not showing up. yesterday, i found that if a delivery point on the sheet is not exactly what enpower has (ie: midway instead of midway-psc), the expanded view just gets rid of it completely. perhaps this should be an error-checking point? find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related. just getting rid of that unrelated name is enough.   extend the size limit of the path.we need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if this was accidental. in the last release, only the data from  was preserved from the previous version.the porpod fields are still the same. we would like the delivery point selection to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see in scheduling. pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. we need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.for some reason, a gobal id is showing up in the expanded view in lines where there is not a global id provided. it is always the same one: ciso_epmi_.path cuts:need to filter region list for cuts by trading desk (east or west).allow hour ranges in the hour # field specifically in he  (military) format (e.g.  - or -).must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.transmission should be optionalmake it easier to show all cuts for a path.allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. a new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut.  i'm not quite sure what you are asking for.  can you give a little more detail? if i create a cut for a single hour, i would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time. kind of an 'add-on' to the original cut. this application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departments, and i expect that they will need features that i have not been able to anticipate. my plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before turning testing over to them, they are aware of this and the time table that we all are trying to meet. i will also help them with their testing to articulate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible. in the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. this needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  the choices for the west are : wscc-s, wscc-n, rockies, northwest, california. corry will be able to provide his region choices.the path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note without hunting for it in the cut path view. the suggestion of a ""go to cut"" button was made in an earlier e-mail.let me know if there is anything that i have missed.thanks,will"

Deal entry the new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  after discussing the matter with stacey white, she recommended entering the new deals in enpower as zero price, non mtm, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount. we should enter notes into enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions. this will allow settlements to match an annuity in enpower with prepay out the door.  it will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.i'm sure that i've missed something.  let me know.regards,tim"

The company has concluded that with this settlement, enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  for the northern natural gas employees, i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas.  over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets.  keep up the good work stan!!"

""thereis still a real market for virtual trading companies, noquestion about it."" enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and,later, other products like rights to high-speed telecommunications networks and financial hedges against changes in the weather. it used a sophisticated onlineplatform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge thecompany's bets. in the words of kurt launer, an analyst who follows enron for credit suisse first boston, the company had ""the pioneering online venture for real-time availability of information"" used in trading commodities.   enron's basic business model, in other words, may yet serve as a model for other companies. in the wake ofenron's bankruptcy filing, some of the best support forthat model model came from its competitors. reliant energy (newsquote) is one of several companies that followed enron in offering online exchanges for electricity and natural gas. ""our commodity markets worked just fine the day after enronwent away,"" said joe bob perkins, president and chiefoperating officer of the wholesale group at reliant. ""everybody got gas, everybody got power, and prices stayed basically the same,"" mr. perkins said. ""the loss of oneintermediary just proves that these competitive marketswork."" other companies offering similar services rushed to fill the gap after enron suspended its trading. ""we've picked upmarket share,"" said stephen l. baum, the chairman,president and chief executive of sempra. he noted, though, that unlike enron, ""our trading, although extremely important and a big income earner for us, is not the centerpiece of our business."" another company that sees continued value in the enron approach is ubs warburg, the swiss investment bank, which bought enron's electricity and gas trading business in bankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under its own brand. ""we're confident we can re-establish the business,"" david walker, a ubs warburg spokesman, said. ""it is a first-ratetrading platform."" similarities between ubs warburg's financial derivative business and enron's trading of energy contracts were one factor that made the deal appealing, mr. walker said. ""thecharacteristics of trading these types of products andbetting on interest rates, which is a core ability of ubs,are similar,"" he said. ""they're kind of neighbors."" mr. kutnick, the research chief, added that enron had""outstanding"" information technology organization that wasbacked by ""tremendous amounts of money."" in that way aswell, he said, the company ""was certainly comparable to thebest financial companies out there."" because of enron's technological advantage, mr. kutnick predicted ubs would have little difficulty regaining enron's market share. ""they were far enough ahead that itshouldn't be an issue,"" he said. ""if you are a coupleseconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a marketinefficiency, obviously you're going to make money."" according to experts who consulted for enron in the field of finance, the company did not necessarily come up with a lot of powerful new ideas. its strength was in synthesizingexisting ideas, which sometimes led to innovative methods. ""they took a lot of finance theory and applied it in the context of their business,"" said ramesh k. s. rao, a prfessor of finance at the university of texas who once consulted for enron. ""there was no magic to what they weredoing."" robert l. mcdonald, a professor of finance at northwestern,advised enron on the use of derivatives from  to .he said the company needed advanced financial tools to price its derivatives, which specified energy products tobe delivered at various times and sites while demand was uncertain. ""that's a hard problem, so they were probablybreaking some new ground trying to deal with that,"" hesaid. ""it's the kind of thing that's easy to describe andmay be hard to do."" peter tufano, a professor at the harvard business school who studied enron, said the company had been using what would be considered ""best practices"" for using derivatives by any ""serious financial firm"" in the early 's. had enron stuck to those practices, mr. kutnick said, it might still survive today. ""enron could have done extremely well with betting on market inefficiencies and hedging bets,"" he said. ""peoplestop hedging because they get too enamored of their owntheories."" as a parallel, he cited long- term capitalmanagement, the hedge fund, which failed in  when itcould no longer cover the ever-higher risks it begantaking. enron also betrayed its success, mr. launer said, by throwing money at ventures that failed to generate cashflow. for example, enron spent around $ billion on its network capacity, or bandwidth, exchange, which never turned a profit. ""the fact that enron became a dot-com, financed itself like a dot-com, and then suffered a demise like a dot-com,"" he said, ""is one of the central parts of this story."" but enron's failed attempts to expand its online trading system to products beyond electricity and natural gas might not rule out future similar endeavors. ""in any commodity, there are always people who have toomuch and others who have too little, so there's alwaysgoing to be a need for them to trade and exchange,""professor tufano said. mr. launer suggested that enron's efforts were simply ill-timed. ""these things take a while to get going,"" hesaid. he noted that the deregulation of electricity and natural gas led to a long period during which the market for energy products and their derivatives evolved. ""it doestake a while before users of a commodity get comfortablewith the idea that they should risk-manage and out-sourcetheir use of that commodity."" http:www.nytimes.combusinessneco.html?ex&ei&enbabhow to advertise---------------------------------for information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the web, please contact alyson racer at alyson@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http:www.nytimes.comadinfofor general information about nytimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.  copyright  the new york times company"

Steve and his firm will work with members of enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  as you know, enron has entered into an agreement with ubs warburg for the sale of netco, enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  in preparation for the transition of netco to ubs, greg whalley has resigned as president and coo of enron to assume a position with ubs warburg.  we want to thank greg and the netco employees joining ubs for their contributions to enron and wish them great success going forward. in addition to engaging steve, enron has formed an office of the chief executive.  i will join steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and ray bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.we will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.thank you for continuing to support enron by performing your job everyday.  the ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. while no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  and in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.link to the press release: http:www.enron.comcorppressroomreleasesenerelease.html"

2002-02-06 14:48:00,inbox_8%2E,.hall@enron.com,susan.amador@enron.com,"wednesday february , : pm eastern time businessweek online daily briefing -- can ubs tame enron's wild traders?daily briefing: news analysis by emily thornton in new york, david fairlamb in zurich, and stephanie anderson forest in dallas back in november, dynegy (nyse:dyn <http:finance.yahoo.comq?sdyn&dt> - news <http:biz.yahoo.comnddyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: buy enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. dynegy fled when enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. now, zurich [switzerland]-based ubs warburg (nyse:ubs <http:finance.yahoo.comq?subs&dt> - news <http:biz.yahoo.comnuubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. the question now is, will the conservative bank be able to impose swiss order on the rogue texas company's traders? on one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $ billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see bw, , ``enron: how good an energy trader?'']. still, ubs had good reason to go for a deal that gave it % of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of  enron employees. obviously, the enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. but managing enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. culture clash. enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former enron trader who asked not to be named. competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $ million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of ubs's massive fixed-income business. although many have signed contracts with ubs that prevent them from leaving enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from ubs after it gets going again. ubs says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``we're confident in the people we have hired,'' says michael hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at ubs warburg. for the scheme to work, however, ubs must persuade enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. and that will be tough: one reason enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. analysts estimate that enron was willing to put as much as $ million at risk on a trade, vs. $. million at dynegy or $ million at duke energy. ubs warburg is willing to put up to $ million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders say its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. ubs'ers abide by tighter controls than at enron. ``smoothing element.'' ubs officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. that's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says ubs president peter a. wuffli. that's in fact what motivated ubs to send a small team down to houston when enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``we don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says ubs ceo john costas. ``we'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' still, anything associated with enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``it's not clear how successful ubs is going to be,'' says jeff dietert, an analyst at investment bank simmons & co. in houston. ``and i think ubs knows that. that's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' some industry insiders doubt that enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. but ubs isn't about to change its own way of doing business. “entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,” says wuffli. swiss family enron? don't bet the chalet on it. go to www.businessweek.com <http:rd.yahoo.comfinanceeditorialbizwkhttp:www.businessweek.com> to see all of our latest stories."
